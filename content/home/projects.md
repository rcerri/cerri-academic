Currently I coordinate two research projects with grants:

* [Automatic Evolution of Deep Neural Networks](https://serrapilheira.org/pesquisadores/ricardo-cerri/), which investigates and proposes new evolutionary approaches using grammatical evolution to automatically evolve deep neural networks. This project has a grant from Instituto Serrapilheira.
* [Identification of SNPs and genes related to grain yield in rice using Machine Learning](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/auxilios/107677/identification-of-snps-and-genes-related-to-grain-yield-in-rice-using-machine-learning/), which investigates Machine Learning methods for the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the production of rice grains. This project has a grant from Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo.

I am currently also involved in different projects related to Data Stream Mining, Active Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Pattern Classification, Multi-objective Optimization, Hierarchical and Multi-label Classification, and Multi-target Classification and Regression, and also predictive and descriptive tasks in bioinformatics, specially those complex ones involving multiple and structured outputs.
